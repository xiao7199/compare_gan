## Ndiv GAN code.
This repo is developed based on the original [compare_gan](https://github.com/google/compare_gan) implementation. We appreaciate authors' effort to organize the code and make it publicly avaliable. 

To run the code:

```shell
python -m pip install -e . --user
compare_gan_prepare_datasets.sh
compare_gan_generate_tasks --workdir=/tmp/results --experiment=ndiv
# Taks num varies from 0 - 5, please check "src/generate_tasks_lib.py" for configuration details
compare_gan_run_one_task --workdir=/tmp/results --task_num=0 --dataset_root=/tmp/datasets
```
## Compare GAN code.

This is the code that was used in "Are GANs Created Equal? A Large-Scale Study"
paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10337) and in "The GAN Landscape: Losses,
Architectures, Regularization, and Normalization"
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04720).

If you want to see the version used only in the first paper - please see the
*v1* branch of this repository.

## Pre-trained models

The pre-trained models are available on TensorFlow Hub. Please see
[this colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/compare_gan/blob/master/compare_gan/src/tfhub_models.ipynb)
for an example how to use them.

### Best hyperparameters

This repository also contains the values for the best hyperparameters for
different combinations of models, regularizations and penalties. You can see
them in `generate_tasks_lib.py` file and train using
`--experiment=best_models_sndcgan`

### Installation:

To install, run:

```shell
python -m pip install -e . --user
```

After installing, make sure to run

```shell
compare_gan_prepare_datasets.sh
```

It will download all the necessary datasets and frozen TF graphs. By default it
will store them in `/tmp/datasets`.

WARNING: by default this script only downloads and installs small datasets - it
doesn't download celebaHQ or lsun bedrooms.

*   **Lsun bedrooms dataset**: If you want to install lsun-bedrooms you need to
    run t2t-datagen yourself (this dataset will take couple hours to download
    and unpack).

*   **CelebaHQ dataset**: currently it is not available in tensor2tensor. Please
    use the
    [ProgressiveGAN github](https://github.com/tkarras/progressive_growing_of_gans)
    for instructions on how to prepare it.

### Running

compare_gan has two binaries:

*   `generate_tasks` - that creates a list of files with parameters to execute
*   `run_one_task` - that executes a given task, both training and evaluation,
    and stores results in the CSV file.

```shell
# Create tasks for experiment "test" in directory /tmp/results. See "src/generate_tasks_lib.py" to see other possible experiments.
compare_gan_generate_tasks --workdir=/tmp/results --experiment=test

# Run task 0 (training and eval)
compare_gan_run_one_task --workdir=/tmp/results --task_num=0 --dataset_root=/tmp/datasets

# Run task 1 (training and eval)
compare_gan_run_one_task --workdir=/tmp/results --task_num=1 --dataset_root=/tmp/datasets
```

Results (all computed metrics) will be stored in
`/tmp/results/TASK_NUM/scores.csv`.
